## About the Project
Skönhetsbutiken is a full-stack e-commerce application designed for users to browse, purchase, and manage beauty products like lashes, glue, and other accessories. It provides an intuitive shopping experience with a modern design, secure authentication, and integrated payment processing.

This project was built as part of my portfolio for the [Diploma in Full Stack Software Development](https://www.codeinstitute.net/) to demonstrate my proficiency in building scalable web applications.
